### About Me
Hi! My name is Stanislava and I recently completed a manual software testing course.
I am starting my journey as a Junior QA Engineer with a solid theoretical foundation and hands-on practice in key testing tools and concepts.

I am familiar with:

- Types and levels of testing
- Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)
- Software development models (e.g., Waterfall, Agile)
- Test design techniques (equivalence partitioning, boundary value, etc.)
- Client-server architecture and HTTP request methods
- SQL for database validation
- API testing with Postman
- Writing test cases, bug reports, and checklists

I enjoy testing because it combines logic, curiosity, and attention to detail.
I love discovering how systems behave, finding edge cases, and helping improve the quality of a product. It is satisfying to know that my work can prevent real problems for users.
